# c_standard_library_remake_42_curriculum
Remake of many c standard library functions as first project for Hive Helsinki. At the time I was learning and experimenting with C syntax. The syntax I used used is not meant to be an example of good, clean code but rather experiments for learning what is possible and what is not in C. 

The school style guide is very restrictive and for examle forbids for loops, assignments when you declare a variable and has a strict maximum size for a function. Thus in some cases the functions are broken down to helper functions rather artificially.
